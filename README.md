# HDDRAY
The small Python code that try to repair slow (and bad) sectors by different methods!

### The new HDDRAY v.16.8.6 version!
Info about this version: 

- Code was made by Copilot instead ChatGPT
- Features like "repair" mode working now fine with big LBAs
- Fixed "max_latency" isuue: code did not recognize hangs

Todo:

- [ ] Autocreation of settings.ini (if missing)
- [ ] Full test of all functions on very big sizes of drives (need a physical bad drive)
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Compatibility for UNIX systems
- [ ] Faster analysis of the sectors (by reading couple of sectors at once instead one-by-one)
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] Help page inside the code
- [ ] Wiki page on GitHub
- [ ] Harddrive locking (sometimes there are errors due to this problem)
