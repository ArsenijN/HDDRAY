# HDDRAY
The small Python code that try to repair slow (and bad) sectors by different methods!

### The new HDDRAY v.16.8.6 version!
Info about this version: 

- Code was made by Copilot instead ChatGPT
- Features like "repair" mode working now fine with big LBAs
- Fixed "max_latency" isuue: code did not recognize hangs

Todo: the todo list only applies to the latest version, on which the work is being done, for the release see the info provided by the release itself

- [x] Harddrive locking (sometimes there are errors due to this problem)
- [x] Better error handling
- [ ] Autocreation of `settings.ini` (if missing)
- [ ] Full test of all functions on very big sizes of drives (need a physical bad drive)
- [ ] Compatibility for UNIX systems
- [ ] Faster analysis of the sectors (by reading couple of sectors at once instead one-by-one)
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] Help page inside the code
- [ ] Wiki page on GitHub
- [ ] Automatic elevation to administrator privileges at startup
- [ ] Handling of insufficient space left in the code place (system just can't write anything to the `list of recovered sectors.txt` because drive was full)

### About
HDDRAY have 4 modes:
- repair
- workout
- f1
- regenerator

All this modes have different behavior when a bad sector is found or when the sector response time does not meet the specified limits

Repair mode:
- read sector
- if access time exceeded: rewrite the sector x times, go to the next sector
- if read error occures: rewrite the sector x times, go to the next sector
- if no errors occured and latency doesn't exceed specified limits, go to the next sector

Workout mode:
- works only after running any other mode
- reads listed sectors from  `list of recovered sectors.txt` and "trains" this sectors
- optionally bad sectors can be "trained" (usually this will not restore this sector, but you can try)
- unstable sectors will be "trained" and if successed - listed as "good/healthy"

F1 mode:
- write specific pattern x times, then read it
- if pattern match, go to the next sector
- if read error occured or pattern didn't match - repair it
- [please add more details]

Regenerator mode:
- works just like repair mode but have other repair settings
- [I forgot what it do]
- [need to rewrite the code]
